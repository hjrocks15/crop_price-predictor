This project aims to predict the prices of various crops using machine learning algorithms. By leveraging historical crop price data along with weather and market conditions, this system provides farmers, traders, and policymakers with insights to make informed decisions.

## Features
Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values, normalizes data, and encodes categorical variables.

Model Selection: Decision Tree

User Interface: A simple interface for users to input atmospheric and weather conditions to get which type of crop will be grown.

## DATASET
The dataset used in this project includes:

Atmospheric contents like N P K
Weather conditions (temperature, rainfall, and humidity)

## Technical skills
Flask
HTML
CSS

## Libraries or frameworks used are as 
scikitlearn, numpy, matplotlib,flas
